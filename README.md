# Advent of Code 2015 - Practicing Ruby

## Overview
I've been coding a lot of different languages in my time, but Ruby was one I actually used to ridicule in a nonchalant way. Now when I'm all grown up and trying to think more freely it was time to tackle a language like this.

I'm currently doing Advent of Code 2018, but in C#. When I'm done with the day's problem for 2018 I'll probably sit and work on my 2015 event until I catch up. I have to go through 2016 and 2017 as well though, perhaps in other languages?
